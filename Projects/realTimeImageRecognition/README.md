# Real-Time Image Recognition

The eventual goal of this work is to identify shapes streaming through a camera device in ROS.  The shapes to be identified are a square, circle, triangle, and cruciform (plus sign), as described in the RobotX [2016](https://www.robotx.org/images/files/2016-MRC-Tasks-2016-11-28.pdf) and [2018](https://www.robotx.org/images/RobotX-2018-Tasks_v2.0.pdf) rules.
