# me696_marineRobotics
Repository for the ME 696 - Marine Robotics and ROS course

1. Directory listing
 - [`Administrative`](/Administrative): files pertaining to course logistics
 - [`StyleGuide`](/StyleGuide): files and links describing programming best practices, conventions, and style guides we will use in the course.
 - [`LectureReadings`](/LectureReadings): files and links with the required course readings, tutorials and assignments.

3. Writing readme.md files
For writing tutorials and/or primer dicuments in Git, put the document in its own directory. Name the directory a properly descriptive name (e.g. "InstallationInstructions", "PackageLists", "WritingAPackage", etc.), then name the document inside the directory "readme.md". This will allow you to leverage Git's built-in writing and formatting syntax, which will allow you to write nicely-formatted documents like the one you are reading right now!
