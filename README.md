Repository for the ME 696 - Marine Robotics and ROS course

1. Directory listing
[`Administrative`](/Administrative): files
PrimerDocuments: detailed notes on a topic.
Projects: files related to a specific project or event.
SurfaceVehicles: files related to the operation of a specific surface vehicle.
Tutorials: detailed notes on the operation, installation, or maintinence of a specific software of hardware.
The difference between PrimerDocuments and Tutorials may be difficult to discern at first. Tutorials should answer the question of "how do I operate this?", primer documents should answer the question of "how does this work?".

3. Writing readme.md files
For writing tutorials and/or primer dicuments in Git, put the document in its own directory. Name the directory a properly descriptive name (e.g. "InstallationInstructions", "PackageLists", "WritingAPackage", etc.), then name the document inside the directory "readme.md". This will allow you to leverage Git's built-in writing and formatting syntax, which will allow you to write nicely-formatted documents like the one you are reading right now!
